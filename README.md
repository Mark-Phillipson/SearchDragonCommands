# SearchDragonCommands

Show and search Dragon commands as you switch from application to application.

This application is written in Visual Basic.net. It links to an XML file of Dragon NaturallySpeaking Advanced Scripts. This XML file can be exported using the Command Browser. By default it should find it in the My Documents folder.

There are two main options. You can show all scripts for all applications including global. Or just show scripts applicable to the current application.

You can also type in a search term to filter by the command name or application.
